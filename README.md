# SierraLoaded Web Scraping Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **web scraping** task where I extracted both **text** and **images** from the [SierraLoaded](https://sierraloaded.sl/) website.  
The images were downloaded and stored in a **local folder**, while the text content was saved for further analysis.  

The scraping was implemented using **Google Colab** with **BeautifulSoup** for HTML parsing.
